DESCRIPTION
===========

The three functions presented here are used with the photon launcher : the first transform a file .off into a file readable by the photon launcher. The second transform a BRDF file (output of the photon launcher) into a file containing the DCRF that you can trace using gnuplot for example. The third one sub sample a .vol file (division by 2 in each direction).

	1) Noff2Pbrt
	2) resizeDCRF
	3) volSubSample

1) syntax : < command > -i file.off - o output
	generate 3 files :  -a geometry file readable by pbrt (outputGeometry.pbrt)
			    -a file (outputImage.pbrt) that can be launched with the originale software pbrt and that gives you a nice 					image (with our photon launcher use >> pbrt -i fileImage.pbrt 
			    -a file (outputPhoton.pbrt)that can be used by the custom photon launcher pbrt. 

	To modify the number of photons launched or the direction of the light, change the parameters in the outputPhoton.pbrt.

		
2) syntax : < command > -i input.txt -o output.txt [--dAngle int(degree)]
	--dAngle : gives the precision on the angle : for example "--dAngle 20" will plot the DCRF with delta theta and delta phi of 20 degree -> default 15 degree.
	A file is generated : "output.txt" that you can use with gnuplot to plot the DCRF : splot "file_brdfResizeDCRF.txt" using 1:2:3:4 with pm3d.

3) syntax : < command > -i input.vol -o output.vol

INSTALL
