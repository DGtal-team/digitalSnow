DESCRIPTION
===========

The two functions presented here are used with the photon launcher : the first transform a file .off into a file readable by the photon launcher. The second transform a BRDF file (output of the photon launcher) into a file containing the DCRF that you can trace using gnuplot for example.

	1) Noff2Pbrt
	2) resizeDCRF


1)syntax : < command > -i file.off - o output
	generate 3 files :  -a geometry file readable by pbrt (outputGeometry.pbrt)
			    -a file (output.pbrt) that can be launched with the initial pbrt software 
				(not our photon launcher) and that gives you a nice image.
			    -a file (outputPhoton.pbrt)that can be used by the photon launcher pbrt remade

	To modify the number of photons launched or the direction of the light, change the parameters in the outputPhoton.pbrt.

		
2)syntax : < command > -i input.txt -o output.txt [--dAngle int(degree)]
	--dAngle : gives the precision on the angle : for example "--dAngle 20" will plot the DCRF with delta theta and delta phi of 20 degree -> default 15 degree.
	A file is generated : "output.txt" that you can use with gnuplot to plot the DCRF : splot "file_brdfResizeDCRF.txt" using 1:2:3:4 with pm3d.

INSTALL
