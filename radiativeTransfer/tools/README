	1) Noff2Pbrt
	2) resizeDCRF

WARNING : in order to use the functions Noff2Pbrt and resizeDCRF, you must be in the same repository as the image you are working on.

1)syntax : < command > file.off
	generate 3 files :  -a geometry file readable by pbrt (fileGeometry.pbrt)
			    -a file (file.pbrt) that can be launched with the initial pbrt software 
				(not our photon launcher) and that gives you a nice image.
			    -a file (filePhoton.pbrt)that can be used by the photon launcher pbrt remade

	To modify the number of photons launched or the direction of the light, change the parameters in the filePhoton.pbrt.

		
2)syntax : < command > "file_brdf.txt" [--dAngle int(degree)]
	--dAngle : gives the precision on the angle : for example "--dAngle 20" will plot the DCRF with delta theta and delta phi of 20 degree -> default 15 degree.
	A file is generated : "file_brdfResizeDCRF.txt" that you can use with gnuplot to plot the DCRF : splot "file_brdfResizeDCRF.txt" using 1:2:3:4 with pm3d.
