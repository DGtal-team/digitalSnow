This repository contains the custom photon tracker used with the digital snow project to study the radiative transfer of a snow sample.

syntax : pbrt [--image || -i] fileImage.pbrt (to launch the initial pbrt software and get a nice image)
	pbrt [--photon || -p]  [--help] [--wavelength wavelength(nm) || -w wavelength(nm)] [-x dimImageX] [-y dimImageY] [-z dimImageZ] [--resPixel PixelResolution(micrometer) || -r PixelResolution(micrometer)] [ <filenamePhoton.pbrt> ] 
	-w : choosen wavelength in nanometers between 700 nm and 2600nm
	-x : dimension of image in X direction (eg "256" for 256*302*247) 
	-r : resolution of one pixel in micrometer 

Three files are generated : 
	a file with general statistics "file_stat.txt" (number of launched photons, albedo ...)
	a file with the absorption ("file_absorb.txt") with 2 columns : depth(m) || % of absorbed photon . For each depth, we have the purcentage of absorbed photons at this depth. If we sum all the purcentage, we may have the total absorption (between 0 and 1). To plot absorption as a function of depth, we just need to cumulate the purcentages; ie with gnuplot : plot "file_absorb.txt" using 1:2:(1.0) smooth cumulative.
	a file "file_brdf.txt" that we can use to plot the brdf. There are 3 columns : theta || phi || numberOfPhoton. For each angle theta(azimuth) in degree and phi(elevation) in degre correspond the number of photons reflected at this angle. 

The sample is duplicated so that almost zero photons are lost and the calculus are identical to an infinite sample.
